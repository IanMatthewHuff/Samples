Functions

A regular binding where the value of the binding is the function.

const square = function(x) {
    return x * x;
};

console.log(square(12));

Functions can have no parameters like so:
const makeNoise = function() {
    console.log("boing");
};
makeNoise();

return with nothing returns undefined.

Bindings all have a scope, same for functions. If it's outside of everything, then it's global.

Local bindings to a function created each time a function is called.

Let and const bindings are local to block. Old pre 2015 JS only functions are new scopes. 
So var is visible through the entire function, not just block.

Innermost scope for a function shadows outer scope.
