Javascript string equals does unicode comparison in order

NaN == NaN // false

Javascript does a ton of type coercsion when it doesn't have the right type for an operator

console.log(8 * null)
// → 0
console.log("5" - 1)
// → 4
console.log("5" + 1)
// → 51

In example 1 null -> 0, in 2 "5" converted to an int, in 3 "1" converted to a string for concat as + tries
string concat before addition
