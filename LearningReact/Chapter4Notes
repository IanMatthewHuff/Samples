Updating the DOM with new elements is slow for performance.

React solves with with a virtual DOM. In that virtual dom we have elements that look like HTML, but are actually JavaScripts elements.

Browser DOM is made of DOM elements. React DOM is made of React elements. A react elements is a description of what the DOM element should look like.

For example:
React.createElement("h1", null, "Baked Salmon")

React.createElement('h1",
            {id: "recipe-0", 'data-type': "title"},
            "Baked Salmon"
)

Turns into:
<h1 data-reactroot id="recipe-0", data-type="title">Baked Salmon</h1>
