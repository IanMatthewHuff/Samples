Supervised Learning - Labeled Data, Direct Feedback, Predict outcome / future
Unsupervised Learning - No Labels, No Feedback, Find hidden structures in data
Reinforcement Learning - Decision Process, Reward system, Learn Series of action

* Supervised learning - Training data has labels, desired output signals (labels) are already known
Picture e-mail spam fiter where we start with a list of mails already correctly marked as spam

Classification is trying to predict the class labels of new instances based on past observations
class labels are discrete unordered values that are the group memberships of instances
labels don't have to be binary (spam / not spam) - multiclass classification could 
take a handwritten letter and determine if it is a - z

Aside from classification we can predict continious outcomes called regression analysis
Given predictor (explanatory) variables and a continuous response variable (target / outcome)
try to find a relationship to explain the outcome

ex. Time spent studying -> SAT test score

* Reinforcement Learning - develop a system (agent) that gets better based on interaction
with environment. Feedback via a "reward signal"

ex. Chess program. Win or loss at the end is the reward signal. The board state is
the environment here

Try to maximize reward at each state of environment, like losing a piece or better board control

* Unsupervized learning - we don't have a known label or reward function with the data here.
Clustering or unsupervized classification to find unknown groups or relationships
Dimensionality reduction - reduce dimensions of data for better analysis and to reduce noise

* basic terms and notation

Basic table info

Flowers
Sample #    length     width    class
1           4.1         7.4     Setosa
2           3.8         8.1     Versicolor

and so on

Data points are "features" length and width
 Each sample represented by a row in a matrix for linear algebra

in this book i is trainging sample j is dimension of training data

** Roadmap for ML systems
    Preprocessing - getting data into shape
        reduce dimensions, scale data to match, remove noise
    Training and selecting predictive model
        every algorithm has pros and cons to it
        get a metric to determing the best, such as classification accuracy
    Evaluating models and predict unseen data
        Separate initial data into training set and test set
        Train with the training set then use test set which is separate to verify accuracy
