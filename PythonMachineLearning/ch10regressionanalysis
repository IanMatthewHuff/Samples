** Regression analysis 

Regression analysis predicts target variables on a contiuous scale not in classes
Like predicting stock prices or weather

** Linear Regression

Model the relationship between one or multiple features and a continous target variable

Learn the weight of the linear equation to describe the relationship between the explanatory variable
and the target variable 

Find the best fitting straight line through the sample points

check the vertical offset from each sample point to the line
reduce these offsets as much as we can

multiple linear regression creates instead a hyperplane
Hard to visualize these, so we mostly stick to 2D

Exploring the housing data set

Exploratory data analysis - simple techniques to examine the dataset

Seaborn can create a pairplot to check the relationship between two variables in the dataset
Can create an entire scatterplot matrix of these charts

** Correlation matrix

like a covariance matrix

Can create a heatmap of correlations between features

For a linear regression we want to pick features with high correlation with target prediction feature

we want to define a cost function to use gradient descent on

Check to see how many epoces it takes to converge

scikit-learn can use liblinear to better optimize
