*** Key Features of Tensorflow ***
Ability to work with one or multiple GPUs
Strong growth with Google behind it
Supports Mobile deployment which is good for production

Tensors are a generalized mathmatical notation for multidim arrays holding
data values where the dimensionality of the tensor is the rank

scalar = tensor rank 0
vector = tensor rank 1
matrix = tensor rank 2

tf.rank to get the rank of a tensor
X.get_shape() similar to numpy arrays

*** Computation Graphs ***
Basically break down an equation into individual operations

Computation graph just a network of nodes. Each node = operations

1. Create a new graph
2. Add nodes (tensors and operations)
3. Run the graph for this session

To evaluate a tensor all the nodes that go into it will be Run

*** Placeholders in tensor flow ***
Predefined tensors with specific types and shape
tf.placeholder function to add them

Like defining a variable with type and rank.

When executing a node in the graph we create a dictionary of values to feed into the
the placeholder values to populate them.

We can specify None for the shape when we are using data with varying sizes

*** Variables in tensor flow ***
Special object to store and update parameters of models when running

For example, weights in the input hidden and output layers

tf.Variable and tf.get_variable

Initial values not actually set until we run the graph

Variable scope to organize the variables into separate subparts. 
Works like a namespace for variables. 

*** Building a regression model ***

*** Executing objects in TensorFlow using names ***

*** Saving and restoring a model ***
tf.train.Saver class to save a model
.save method

Uses Protocol buffer as a language agnostic way to serialize data. 

We can recreate the graph and restore the trained model with the meta file

*** Transforming tensors as MD data arrays ***

*** Utilizing control flow mechanics in building graphics ***
In our code we need to use tf.cond for something like x > y
If you just use the python operator then it will be static and frozen in the graph
we need the tf.cond to have it actually apply to each item.

tf.case and tf.while_loop for more control flow

*** Tensor Board ***
This is a module to create visualizations of the graph
variable_scope will cause items to get grouped into network boxes. You can expand them to explore inside
